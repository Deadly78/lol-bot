// notes
- v3 api omits some info for public games (ex: summoner names omitted from matches api), therefore need some workarounds
- finds matching data by comparing step3 and 4, therefore, only works in game modes with unique champs
- stats to track
	- hilow kda
	- hilow kills
	- hilow deaths
	- hilow damage
	- hi damage taken
